title: Gamify AWS and HCP
teaser: A gamified workshop for accounts using AWS and HCP services. Use this track
  to generate excitement for an account with relevant architecture.
description: "This track is designed to be used in a full day event where participants
  compete by completing the challenges in a 3 hour time limit.\n\n### The challenges\n-
  \ ☁️ Hook up your Terraform code/workspace to Terraform Cloud (team token provided)\n-
  \ \U0001F433 Build and push a Docker container for the X application to AWS ECR
  (source code provided)\n-  \U0001F4DD Use Terraform to provision an AWS Lambda function
  and an AWS RDS instance for the X application\n-  \U0001F680 Use Terraform to configure
  your HCP Vault namespace (namespace provided)\n-  \U0001F512 Secure the X application's
  database connection running in AWS Lambda using HashiCorp Vault\n\n### Scoring considerations\n-
  Does it work? ✅\n- The application has a publicly available URL: 200 OK response
  (32)\n- Did you use Terraform Cloud to deploy it? (32)\n- Terraform coding style
  (up to 8)\n- Use Terraform Cloud VCS driven runs (8)\n- Lambda integration with
  HCP Vault (16)\n- Completion time (up to 8)\n\n### Bonus\n - Use of 1 or more Terraform
  Cloud policy sets (8)\n - Use of Terraform Cloud dynamic AWS credentials (8)\n -
  Use Vault's dynamic database secrets engine with the lambda (8)\n\nPerfect score:
  **128** (in reference to 128-bit era gaming consoles)\n\n### Tracking completion
  time\n\nTo effectively track completion time, you will need to utilize Instruqt's
  \"live event\" type when creating the invite for the event. This will allow you
  to see the progress of each participant and report on it for scoring purposes."
