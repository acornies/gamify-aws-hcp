ðŸ‘‹ Getting Started
===============

Use the web-based VS Code IDE to your advantage and bring up the integrated terminal window with key shortcut:

**ctrl + `**

Next, connect to your VS Code workspace with a  Terraform Cloud workspace. In order to authenticate with Terraform Cloud, you will need an API team token. Your facilitator has supplied this token in your respective HCP Vault namespace. Please verify that you have access to:

- A Terraform Cloud organization and project (UI)
- An HCP Vault namespace (UI)

Once ready, create a new file named `main.tf` and configure the Terraform CLI remote backend:

```
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "<your-org>"

    workspaces {
      name = "<your-workspace-name>"
    }
  }
}
```
Replace the organization and workspace name values accordingly.

Now that we have the remote backend defined, copy & paste the `team_token` value in `kv/terraform` from your HCP Vault namespace and use it in the login prompt.

```
cd /app && terraform login
```

Assuming you're successfully authenticated, initialize the repository with:

```
terraform init
```

To complete this challenge, press **Check**.
